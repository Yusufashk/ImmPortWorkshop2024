This tutorial was presented at the FOCiS convention at 2024 in San Fransisco, and was developed by the ImmPort team and UCSF.
This is a tutorial on how to use AI tools such as chat GPT in combination with Python in a Jupyter lab enviornment.
There is the PDF slideshow of how to use this tutorial, with videos that show each step.
Part 1(Part 2 in the slideshow) is the exploratory analysis, where we explore our Vacine response dataset downloaded from immpornt.
Part 2(Part 4 in the slideshow) is the statistical analysis, where we run some analysis on ELISA data, and compare vacine response between the LAIV and TIV vaccine types, 
and also within different demographic groups.
We have an additional tutorial on how we used the API to download data in the ApiTutorial folder
